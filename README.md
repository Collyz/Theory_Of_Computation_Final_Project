# Theory of Computation Final Project

### About:
Our goal for this project was to create a Finite Automata designer that would allow you to build an FA by hand and then be able to input strings into the program to be parsed. We decided this would be a great project idea to demonstrate our expertise in the subject, as well as be able to deploy our programming skills to develop a website that may be usable in the real-world.

### Contributers:
 + Mohammed Mowla (Collyz)
 + Parth Patel (ParthP22)
 + Serena Su (sjsusu)

### Limitations:
- This was only made for Deterministic Finite Automata. Non-determinism was beginning to get too complicated, and building the program for DFAs turned out to be a cumbersome endeavor on its own.
- We were not able to implement a feature that allows the user to step through the DFA state-by-state to see how the machine actually parses an input string.

### Libraries
 + P5.js
